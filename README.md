# Clinic Companion NG 🏥
Prepare better for your hospital visit (Nigeria-friendly, civilian-friendly).

## What this app does
This Streamlit web app helps users:
- Understand common checks doctors do in the clinic (BP, temperature, pulse, PCV, glucose)
- See what a clinician may want to check next (not diagnoses)
- Identify urgent warning signs that require medical attention
- Generate smart questions to ask during a hospital visit
- Produce a short copy/paste summary for the clinician

## Why it fits the assignment
- It solves a real everyday problem in Nigeria: patients often arrive anxious, with partial results and little time to explain.
- It uses structured logic (reference ranges + red-flag checks + question generation) to deliver helpful outputs.
- It is simple, practical, and publicly deployable.
